#+DESCRIPTION: UNREPL.el contribution guidelines
#+LANGUAGE:  en
#+STARTUP: showall

UNREPL.el is a very young project, so contribution guidelines are fairly simple
and straight forward.

* Bug Reporting and Feature Suggestions

  Please refer to the [[https://github.com/unrepl/unrepl.el/issues][issue tracker]].

* Code contributions

  These are even better than the above! Feel free to open [[https://github.com/unrepl/unrepl.el/pulls][pull requests]].  Be
  careful to create atomic commits with descriptive messages; when in doubt,
  please refer to [[https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules][these seven rules]].
